- [DONE] [H] Add note onclick

- Unit test helper
    - [DONE] [M] get a div to init the vexflow ready to test
    - [L] Find a way to test private methods

- Container
    - [H] Keep track of list of measures (Basically add a link list)
    - [H] Make container to know the default value of beats and their values of measures
    - [M] Need a better toolbar
    - [M] Conatiner can have multiple staves
    - [M] Able to add tablature
    - Improve container init process
        - [M] Let the container to get the init tickables.

    - [DONE] [H] Set isRemovable flag of the predefined tickables of measure
    - [DONE] [H] Exchange the removable tickables with added tickable
    - [BUG] [H] Measure is not smart enough to increase its width so that it couldn't contain many small notes

    - [H] Get the note key from onclick position
    - [H] Put the note according to positionn of onclick (Between other notes or something like that)
    - [H] Event Handling Idea
        - Probably it's good to put a recatngle on top of the note and handle events on that. Needs a research and test though. This can be done on draw function.
        - [H] Set onclicked note selected and return the object
    - [M] Good to show removable notes in another color
    - [M] Appear a rounded toolbar when mouse clicked a note (something like google+ circle)

        - [DONE] [H] Complete measure unit test
